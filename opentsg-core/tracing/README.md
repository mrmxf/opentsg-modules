# Tracing

Tracing uses [OpenTelemetry][OTEL] to run the tracing
of OpenTSG.

This library provides the middleware for checking the events that
occur in OpenTSG and their parents that caused them. As well
as offering memory profiling of the widgets.
Allowing you to build up an image of how OpenTSG has run,
in real time if you are using Jaeger as an add on.

## Using Tracing

The tracing provides a way to trace openTSG as it is running,
with low impact middleware plugins that can be used in tandem
with other middlewares.

Get the tracing library with the following command.

```cmd
go get "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tracing"
```

Now you have the tracing library lets integrate it into your
code.

## Using Jaeger

If you want to plug the tracing straight into [Jaeger][JGR],
because it uses Open Telemetry as a base,
so you can plug OpenTSG straight into jaeger and start visualising
your tracing results.

To get Jaeger started follow the instructions on
[the website][JSTRT]

This boils down to running the following command

```cmd
docker run --rm --name jaeger \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/jaeger:2.5.0
```

You can then view your traces at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)

To use the Jaeger follow the examples below,
but swap out `tracing.InitProvider` for `tracing.InitJaeger`

### Initialising a Tracer

To start the tracing, you first need to make
a tracer object and to start it.

Where you create the tracer, you then start it
to generate a parent context, which you pass onto child
tracers and spans.

Then you have to end the tracer and close it.
In that order, if you close it before you end it then
the final trace is not flushed leading to
potential errors down the line.

The tracer is intialised
and started with the following code.

```go
// handle your own error
tracer, closer, _ := tracing.InitProvider(nil)
ctx := context.Background()

// run a tracer
// and generate the context with
// the tracer body
c, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "OpenTSG",
trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindInternal))

// End the span then close the tracer
defer func() {
    span.End()
    closer(c)
}()

// Create middlewares from here and run the program
// Or manually create a trace
```

The context can be used to intialise any middleware
you would like to use, as it gives the parent trace
as OpentTSG.

This library utilises the openTelemetry SDK of
`"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"`, which can
be used to customise the tracer object with the
`sdktrace.TracerProviderOption` type.

The `tracing.Resources`function also creates fields
for the tracer to use, with the following fields:

- ServiceVersion
- ServiceName
- JobID

#### Middleware

Tracing middleware for OpenTSG is provided and can be utilised
with the following code.

```go

import (
    "time"
    "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tracing"
    "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tsg"
)

func main() {
    tracer, closer, _ := tracing.InitProvider(nil)
    ctx := context.Background()

    // run a tracer
    // and generate the context with
    // the tracer body
    c, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "OpenTSG",
    trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindInternal))

    // End the span then close the tracer
    defer func() {
        span.End()
        closer(c)
    }()

    otsg, _ := tsg.BuildOpenTSG(commandInputs, *profile, *debug, 
        &tsg.RunnerConfiguration{RunnerCount: 1, ProfilerEnabled: true}, myFlags...)

    // c is the context returned when the tracer
    // is started
    otsg.Use(tracing.OtelMiddleWare(c, tracer))

    // run the engine
    otsg.Run("")

}
```

This logs:

- Start time
- End time
- The job ID
- The openTSG version
- The widget being run

If you want to profile the engine then you can use
one of the profiling middlewares, such as the example
below.

```go
import (
    "time"
    "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tracing"
    "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tsg"
)

func main() {
    tracer, closer, _ := tracing.InitProvider(nil)
    ctx := context.Background()

    // run a tracer
    // and generate the context with
    // the tracer body
    c, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "OpenTSG",
    trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindInternal))

    // End the span then close the tracer
    defer func() {
        span.End()
        closer(c)
    }()

    otsg, _ := tsg.BuildOpenTSG(commandInputs, *profile, *debug, 
        &tsg.RunnerConfiguration{RunnerCount: 1, ProfilerEnabled: true}, myFlags...)

    // c is the context returned when the tracer
    // is started
    pseudoTSG.Use(tracing.OtelMiddleWareAvgProfile(c, tracer, 100*time.Millisecond))
    // run the engine
    otsg.Run("")
}
```

This logs:

- Start time
- End time
- The job ID
- The openTSG version
- The widget being run
- The current memory allocation being used in bytes - `Alloc`
- The total memory in bytes used in the lifetime of the program - `TotalAlloc`
- The memory heaps in bytes, in use by the program - `HeapInUse`
- The total percentage of the CPU in use by the program, that is used by the
Garbage Cleaner - `GCCPUFraction`
- The total Bytes used by the heap - `HeapAlloc`
- The number of objects in the heap - `HeapObjects`

#### SearchMiddleware

Tracing middleware is also provided for
the `SearchWithCredentials` function and can
be added like so.

```go

import (
    "time"
    "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tracing"
    "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tsg"
)

func main() {
    tracer, closer, _ := tracing.InitProvider(nil)
    ctx := context.Background()

    // run a tracer
    // and generate the context with
    // the tracer body
    c, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "OpenTSG",
    trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindInternal))

    // End the span then close the tracer
    defer func() {
        span.End()
        closer(c)
    }()

    otsg, _ := tsg.BuildOpenTSG(commandInputs, *profile, *debug, 
        &tsg.RunnerConfiguration{RunnerCount: 1, ProfilerEnabled: true}, myFlags...)

    // Add the tracing middleware
    pseudoTSG.UseSearches(tracing.OtelSearchMiddleWareProfile(tracer))

    // run the engine
    otsg.Run("")
}

```

This logs:

- Start time
- End time
- The URI of the data
- The size of the data extracted in bytes.

#### Context Middleware

Tracing middleware is also provided for
the context function and can
be added like so.

```go

import (
    "time"
    "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tracing"
    "github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/opentsg-core/tsg"
)

func main() {
    tracer, closer, _ := tracing.InitProvider(nil)
    ctx := context.Background()

    // run a tracer
    // and generate the context with
    // the tracer body
    c, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "OpenTSG",
    trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindInternal))

    // End the span then close the tracer
    defer func() {
        span.End()
        closer(c)
    }()

    otsg, _ := tsg.BuildOpenTSG(commandInputs, *profile, *debug, 
        &tsg.RunnerConfiguration{RunnerCount: 1, ProfilerEnabled: true}, myFlags...)

    // Add the tracing middleware
    pseudoTSG.UseSearches(tracing.OtelContextMiddleWareProfile(c, tracer, 100 * time.Millisecond))

    // run the engine
    otsg.Run("")
}

```

This logs:

- Start time
- End time
- The job ID
- The openTSG version
- The widget being run
- The current memory allocation being used in bytes - `Alloc`
- The total memory in bytes used in the lifetime of the program - `TotalAlloc`
- The memory heaps in bytes, in use by the program - `HeapInUse`
- The total percentage of the CPU in use by the program, that is used by the
Garbage Cleaner - `GCCPUFraction`
- The total Bytes used by the heap - `HeapAlloc`
- The number of objects in the heap - `HeapObjects`

#### Writing to Slog

To write to the `logging/slog`library

```go
tracing.SlogInfoWriter{}
```

can be used as an io.Writer, this writes to the default slog.
At a log level of `slog.LevelInfo`.

#### Manually creating a Trace

Traces can be created manually as well as from using the
middleware functions provided.

To manually create a trace event
the following example

```go

import (
    "context"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace"
)

func ExampleFunc(ctx context.Context, tracer trace.Tracer){
    traceCtx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "myExampleName",
        trace.WithAttributes(),
        trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindInternal),
    )
    // end the span at the end of the function
    defer span.End()

    // Write the rest of the function here
}
```

If the context contains previous tracer information,
then the trace will inherit this and make it the parent of that trace.

## What to add / finish

- [ ] Add more Context based middleware for Tracing
  - [ ] Decide what to do with the search middleware - should this become context middleware or be left the same
  - [ ] Add more useful fields to the context to be extracted
- [ ] Add better name tags to context names
- [ ] Write more tests - optional
- [ ] Other plugins for modules like grafana etc
