## Test Signal Input Geometry (TSIG)

A TSIG file is used to generate images for non flat screens. e.g. a sphere or a cube

It works by mapping the geometry to a flat layout of the object, which forms the
base test pattern image all the test pattern widgets are drawn to. Keeping the same
coordinate system OpenTSG normally uses.

For example this house.

<img src="./_images/houseBlenderView.jpg" alt="Blender House" width="300"/>

e.g. would be unwrapped as a [TSIG](./gridgen/testdata/tpig/house.json) into this flat shape.

<img src="./_images/houseFlat.jpeg" alt="House TSIG" width="500"/>

OpenTSG would then produce a test pattern (e.g. EBU 3373) that looks like:

<img src="./_images/houseEbu.png" alt="House TSIG" width="500"/>

Which then wraps round the house like so.

<img src="./_images/houseBlenderViewWrapped.jpg" alt="House TSIG" width="500"/>

Each TSIG generates specifies the size of an image, so a TSIG will not
generate an image for 6 sizes of cubes, just the image for the one cube it represents.

To see TSIGs being put into action in OpenTSG check out this [walkthrough](https://github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-node/blob/main/READMETPIG.md)
and generate these images yourself.
Or check the [Gridgen](_docs/gridgen/doc.md) docs to find more about how TSIGs work.
